# here we give details about our marker sets.  Note that a marker
# set can be both genome-focused and target_fasta-focused, as
# I have done with ROSA here, just for an example.

# Note also that we have allowed for two different target_fastas
# for ROSA which will give us two different possible ROSA sets, possibly.
# It seemed like that would be good in order to test different
# target_fastas side-by-side, etc.

# Also, each target_fasta is assumed to belong to only one marker_set,
# but a particular full genome can belong to multiple marker sets.

# And we can map a marker set to more than one full genome...as the
# LFAR example with a genome called "nookie2" shows.

# But, also note that we can have multiple variant sets for each genome
# within a genome-focused marker set.

# The "variants" field is reserved only for the canonical SNP-sets that we would
# use to call specific variants.  Not for finding new variants, etc.

#This is for the panel that Diana created, which we sequenced 3 plates with
